### Problematic code:

```shell
#!/bin/sh
echo "${var//foo/bar}"
```

### Correct code:

Either switch the shebang to `bash` or `ksh`, or rewrite the expansion using a tool like `sed`:

```shell
#!/bin/sh
echo "$var" | sed 's/foo/bar/g'
```

### Problematic code:

```shell
sum=find | wc -l
```

### Correct code:

## In POSIX sh, $'..' is undefined.

https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC3003

### Problematic code:

```shell
#!/bin/sh
IFS=$' \t\n'
```

### Correct code:

```shell
#!/bin/sh
# Note: \n can not be last, or it will be stripped by $()
IFS=$(printf ' \n\t')
```

or

```shell
#!/bin/sh
# Trailing linefeed added literally
IFS="$(printf ' \t')
"
```

or

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Bash supports this
IFS=$' \t\n'
```
